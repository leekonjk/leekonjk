# 💫 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm currently learning and building with **Unity** and **Flutter**, working on creative projects — and planning to **combine both platforms** into something fun and innovative! 🎨🚀

---

## 🚧 Currently Working On

### 🎮 Unity – Game Development
I'm developing a **Temple Run–style endless runner game** with features like:
- ✅ Base system for player movement
- ✅ Procedural chunk generation
- ⬜ Obstacle and coin system
- ⬜ Score and distance UI tracking
- ⬜ Gameplay polishing and VFX

> 💡 *Currently learning:* Unity UI System – Canvas, Buttons, Panels, TextMeshPro

---

### 📱 Flutter – Mobile App Development
Working on a multi-page Flutter app that includes:
- ✅ Navigation: Home, About Us, Feedback
- ✅ TikTok Video Downloader UI
- ⬜ Improved UX with animations & themes
- ⬜ Backend integration (Firebase or REST API)

---

### 🔄 Mixing Both Worlds – Flutter + Unity
Experimenting with ideas that combine both platforms:
- ⬜ Connect Flutter app with Unity game
- ⬜ Build companion apps (like scoreboards, remote controls)
- ⬜ Share data between apps
- ⬜ Hybrid experiments (e.g., leaderboard sync, notifications)

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Flutter intermediate topics: `state management`, `animations`, `REST APIs`
- Unity UI system and `event handling`
- Real-world Git & GitHub workflows
